# Notes

## Introduction

Most of the notes are from my undergraduate and postgraduate courses and written in Typst (https://typst.app/). There are only **useful** (in my opinion) definitions and theorems so that I can focus on coding or analysis instead of the proof.

Please feel free if you want to use them, **but there's no guarantee of correctness.**

Please let me know if there are bugs or suggestions, and my email is zeyu.wang.0117@outlook.com.
